## Prerequisites

All the necessary dependencies for building the game are listed in the official documentation:

## How to install?

1. Download the script.
2. Run it inside the folder where you want your game versions to be installed.
3. *(Optional)* Create a `MyInit.txt` file to include your custom `init` commands.

> ⚠️ **Warning:** If `MyInit.txt` is present, it will overwrite the original `Init.txt` file.  
> It's recommended to make a backup of the original file before replacing it.
